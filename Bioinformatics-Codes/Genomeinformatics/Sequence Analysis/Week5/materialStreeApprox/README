After installing the genometools and setting GTDIR and CC
Try the following commands (depending on the exercise to be solved)

./download.sh 1
./index.sh Ecoli_K12 Ecoli_K12.fna
make stree-exact-match.x

./download.sh 1
./index.sh Ecoli_K12 Ecoli_K12.fna
make stree-approx-match.x

./download.sh 1
./index.sh Ecoli_K12 Ecoli_K12.fna
make stree-minunique.x

./download.sh 1 2
./index.sh Ecoli_K12_O127 Ecoli_K12.fna Ecoli_O127_H6.fna
make stree-mum.x

The following commands will initially fail, as the empy functions do not
deliver any results. As soon as these have correctly been implemented, it will
hopefully be successful.

make test-exact-match
make test-approx-match
make test-minunique
make test-mum
