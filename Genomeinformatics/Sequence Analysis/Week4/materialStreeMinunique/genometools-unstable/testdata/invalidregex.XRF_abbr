!Abbreviations for cross-referenced databases.
!
!Note that url's are not necessarily stable entities and that some
!databases may have many other access routes or mirror sites.
!
! NOTE:  a newline follows before the first entry

! Here's the root SGD database where we get gene products.
! Note that there is no shorthand name, since we want any
! applications to use 'SGD' as the shorthand name.
! Also note the trailing # on the generic_url.  This is a 
! somewhat standard way of referencing a url when being used
! as an identifier.  It doesn't interfere with linking.

abbreviation: SGD
database: Saccharomyces Genome Database.
object: gene product
example_id: S0004660
local_id_syntax: ^[
generic_url: http://www.yeastgenome.org/
url_syntax: http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/SGD/locus.pl?locus=

! Here are the SGD references.  Note that References has been added to 
! the generic_url to make it unique.  This is a good convention to follow.

abbreviation: SGD_REF
shorthand_name: SGD
database: Saccharomyces Genome Database.
object: Reference Citation.
example_id: 12031
generic_url: http://www.yeastgenome.org/

! Here's one from flybase.  Note that the generic_url field has been
! repeated since there is a mirror.  Also, the shorthand_name has been
! filled in as FlyBase, since this is less than 10 characters.

abbreviation: FB
shorthand_name: FlyBase
database: FlyBase.
object: gene product
example_id: FBgn0000024
